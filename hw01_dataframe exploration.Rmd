## Dataset Discription

The dataset `larin` is available to use in R package `TSA`, which is a one dimensional time series containing 115 observations froim 1878 to 1992:
```{r load, message= FALSE}
library(TSA)
data(larain)
```

```{r}
summary(larain)
```

Sequence plotï¼š

```{r pressure, fig.dim = c(6, 4), fig.align='center'}
plot.ts(larain)
```

## Time Series Analysis

### Tools 
Our goal is to build a time serie model to fit the `larain` data and predit rain volume in the future.

Some packages may be used:

|    **Packages**    | **Discription** |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| `TSA`  |  white noise test  |
| `tseries`| adf test(stationary test)  |
| `forecast` | forcast by auto generating ARIMA model|
| `astsa` | SARIMA model |

### Model Building Strategy

1. Visualize the series
2. Stationarize the series
3. Model identification
  * ARIMA
  * GARCH
4. Finding optimal parameters
5. Prediction


### White Noise and Stationary Test

Before we apply any models, we use Box-test to see if the data has any information. If it is a totally random series, then there is no point to use any model building strategy.

```{r}
Box.test(larain,type="Ljung-Box")
```
It is clearly shown on the outcome that the data is basically a white noise, which means the data is a sequence of independent sample. Therefore, there is no reason to continue.
